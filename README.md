Temaki is an Android app for quickly creating simple lists.

Try the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jmartin.temaki)

Android Libraries
==============

Temaki uses the following third-party libraries:

  - Google GSON

# Sync

Dropbox Sync was initially planned for version 1.5, but was dropped due to complications with conflicting methods of using list
names as tables names in the Dropbox Datastore API. Sync has been deferred for now due to my personal time constraints, with no 
plans to continue it at the moment.

However, there is still a desire to add Sync to Dropbox, and any help is appreciated!


Android Device Support
===================

Temaki is supported on all Android devices running Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 and higher. There are currently no plans to support devices below 4.0, but discussion and support is welcome.

Android Tablet Support
===================

As of version 1.0, the app is not yet optimized for tablets. There are currently no plans to have it supported for Android tablets at this moment.
